# CppProjects
Grant's Cpp Projects.
This repository includes some of my trial works and interesting gadgets written in C/C++. I divide the repository into two branches: master and PRIMER.

## Branch: master
### B2C_FileUploader
An automatic and multithread file transmission system based on Win Socket. Each client can automatic scan particular files on dist and 
then send them to Server. Note that the server supports multithread technique, which allows multi-clients upload at a same time.

###Exercies
Nothing interesting, only the homework solution for the piece-of-cake C++ Programming course.

##sqlite_cookiemgmt
An interesting gadget which automatically manage Chorme's cookies with sqlite. This is a experiment on the sqlite internel mechanism.


##Branch: PRIMER

###YFLab
This is a socket server program which can communicate with STM32 MCU. I write this for a project concerning "Smart Home" issue.
The program can real-time sampling the temperature, humidity, smoke condition from STM32 and send them to the JaveEE Server(also written
by me, can be viewed in Java Project repository).

###PRIMER
The solution for C++ Primer Plus book.
